OpenAgent is an open-source AI coding agent that brings powerful AI models directly into your terminal. A fork of Google's Gemini CLI, it provides access to all major coding AI models from x-ai, anthropic, qwen, google, openai, more - combining the robust features of Gemini CLI with the flexibility to use any model you prefer.

## üöÄ Why OpenAgent?

- **ü§ñ Multi-model support**: Use Gemini, GPT, Claude, and other coding AI models
- **üéØ Free tier**: 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day with Gemini (via Google account)
- **üß† Powerful models**: Access Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M context), GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and more
- **üîß Built-in tools**: Google Search grounding, file operations, shell commands, web fetching
- **üîå Extensible**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for custom integrations
- **üíª Terminal-first**: Designed for developers who live in the command line
- **üõ°Ô∏è Open source**: Apache 2.0 licensed

- **Pull Request Reviews**: Automated code review with contextual feedback and suggestions
- **Issue Triage**: Automated labeling and prioritization of GitHub issues based on content analysis
- **On-demand Assistance**: Mention `@openagent` in issues and pull requests for help with debugging, explanations, or task delegation
- **Custom Workflows**: Build automated, scheduled and on-demand workflows tailored to your team's needs

## üîê Authentication Options

Choose the authentication method that best fits your needs:

> **Note**: Google OAuth login is not available in OpenAgent. Use one of the following authentication methods instead.

### Option 1: Gemini API Key

**‚ú® Best for:** Developers who need specific model control or paid tier access

**Benefits:**

- **Free tier**: 100 requests/day with Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Model selection**: Choose specific Gemini models
- **Usage-based billing**: Upgrade for higher limits when needed

```bash
# Get your key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
openagent
```

### Option 2: Vertex AI

**‚ú® Best for:** Enterprise teams and production workloads

**Benefits:**

- **Enterprise features**: Advanced security and compliance
- **Scalable**: Higher rate limits with billing account
- **Integration**: Works with existing Google Cloud infrastructure

```bash
# Get your key from Google Cloud Console
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
openagent
```

### Option 3: OpenRouter

**‚ú® Best for:** Developers who want access to multiple AI models beyond Gemini

**Benefits:**

- **Multi-model access**: Use Gemini, Claude, GPT-4, Llama, and many more models
- **Unified API**: Single API key for all models
- **Flexible routing**: Automatically route to available providers
- **Usage-based billing**: Pay only for what you use across all models

```bash
# Get your key from https://openrouter.ai
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
openagent
```

For more details on OpenRouter support, see the [OpenRouter guide](./docs/openrouter.md).

For Google Workspace accounts and other authentication methods, see the [authentication guide](./docs/cli/authentication.md).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Basic Usage

#### Start in current directory

```bash
openagent
```

#### Include multiple directories

```bash
openagent --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Use specific model

```bash
openagent -m gemini-2.5-flash
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
openagent -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase"
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use
the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:

```bash
openagent -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --output-format json
```

### Quick Examples

#### Start a new project

```bash
cd new-project/
openagent
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

#### Analyze existing code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshbickett/openagent
cd openagent
openagent
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
